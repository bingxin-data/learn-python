One-off and exploratory notebooks.

## Data for `prophet.ipynb`

The notebook expects Lending Club loan data in `data/`:

- `LoanStats_2019Q1.csv`
- `LoanStats_2019Q2.csv`

These files are not in the repo (they’re large). Download them from [Lending Club’s historical data](https://www.lendingclub.com/investors/structured-funds/loan-and-note-performance) or another source, then place the CSVs in this folder under `data/` (e.g. `playground/data/LoanStats_2019Q1.csv`).
